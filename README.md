By Mr Speaker

Canvas & WebGL game for the french "No Future Contest" with my chosen constraint, "tous les programmeurs sont morts (le jeu doit exploiter le concept/l’esthétique du bug/glitch)".

    Move: stick / keys
    Build: button 1 / space
    Erase: button 2 / x
    Fast: both buttons

## Bugz & TODO

- french version
- players can stack and never separate
- time is real time, not game time. don't change tabs!
- sfx toggle in paws
- music toggle in paws
- pretty-fy paws
- no ajax error handling when loading levels

## Ideaz

- panic mode: click on player, makes them idle
- glitch in time to the moosic.
- when "bitten", move a bit to stop stacking.
